* Apache 


## Installation

1. Installation of Apache (Any web-server will do, but I prefer Apache) iincluding PHP. This guide from howtoraspberrypi is helpful for beginners (https://howtoraspberrypi.com/how-to-install-web-server-raspberry-pi-lamp/)
1. Build and Install OpenCV. I used '4.0.0-alpha'. However, you can use the most up to date version. This tutorial will get you started at [pyimagesearch]https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/09/04/raspbian-stretch-install-opencv-3-python-on-your-raspberry-pi/
1. Clon, Build and Install the OpenKinect library. [Here]https://naman5.wordpress.com/2014/06/24/experimenting-with-kinect-using-opencv-python-and-open-kinect-libfreenect/ is a great tutorial for doing just that.
