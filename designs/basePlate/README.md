# Base Plate Design

1. Base plate for instaling electronic onto within the main control box. The `basePlateCut.pdf` file contain the traces for cutting on any laser cutter using 3mm laser plywood.
2. The `basePlateEngrave.png` file contains matching images for engraving the positions and labeling on the plate.
3. Eight 'standoff.stl` peices can be used to create a gap betweent the base plate and any electronics enclosure allowing for cable passthrough. These are best 3D printed in PLA and the four mounting holes in the corner of the base plate used to attach them.
